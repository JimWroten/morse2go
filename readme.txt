Morse2Go is a small portable device that helps people with disabilities communicate. 
Specifically, the target users include people with disabilities involving speech and 
movement. But by moving a finger, toe, arm, head or using a puff/sip mouth switch, 
a person can key text messages into the M2G. Their words will be displayed on a 
small LCD screen, smartphone or computer. 

The M2G is an Arduino Due project. The source code consists of three files m2g_1.ino,
m2g.cpp and m2g.h. In addition, the libraries Adafruit_CC3000 and Stopwatch are used,
in addition to the standard Arduino libraries.
